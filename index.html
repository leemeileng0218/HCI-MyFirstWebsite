    <a href="https://kawazuzakura.jp/">"https://kawazuzakura.jp/"</a> <p>Kawazu Cherry Blossom Fstival.
   <p> From Tokyo to Kawazu, my companion and I traveled by train for two and a half hours. I'm watching Cherry Blossom for the first time. 
    This is known as Kawazu-Zakura, and its vivid pink hue and big petals are its distinguishing features.
    Perhaps since it's the final day of the Cheery Blossom Festival, it's packed.
    The view in Kawazu is stunning, with a blue sky, a clean river, and cherry blossoms..

    <p>Shirakawa-go & Ainokura.
   <p> We took a day trip to Gokayama Ainukura and Shirakawa-go from Takayama Station by Nohi bus company. 
    After an hour's trip from Takayama Station, we reach Ainokura Gassho-Zukuri Village.  The Gokayama region's most isolated settlement is Ainokura.  With around 20      gassho-Zukuri farmhouses, it is also the biggest settlement.  "Constructed like hands in prayer" is the meaning of Gassho-Zukuri.  The architectural design is intended to endure the region's high winter snowfall.
 We spend an hour in Ainokura Village before moving on to the next village, Shirakawa-go.  The village of Shiwakawa-go is really lovely and covered in snow.
 We went to the Museum of Silk Culture, also known as Tajima House. This museum describes the history and methods of silk growing, which was one of the major enterprises in pre-modern Shirakawago.

         <p>Mount Putuo (Meijin-Ge Hotel)
   <p> My family and i had a very memorable two day trip to Mount Putuo. This was because there was a typhoon before we arrived, and another typhoon was expected to hit before we left, which would cause the ferries to be suspended. During our stay at Mount Putuo, i felt very comfortable and peaceful.
     <p>Soon I will continue and share my next trip!</p>
